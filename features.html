                        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
                        <p>This semester, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a group of my peers on a project for one of my courses. The task was to design and build a small-scale model of a sustainable residential structure. To approach this challenge, our team first met to discuss our individual strengths, interests, and ideas. We then divided the various responsibilities, such as researching building materials, drafting the floor plan, and constructing the physical model. Throughout the process, we held regular meetings to share progress updates, troubleshoot any issues, and ensure our individual contributions aligned with the overall vision. The need to balance our diverse perspectives and coordinate our efforts required strong communication, compromise, and teamwork. By drawing on each member's unique skills and perspectives, we were able to produce a cohesive and innovative final product that exceeded our initial expectations. This collaborative experience has reinforced the value of working with others to tackle complex challenges and has improved my ability to contribute effectively within a team setting.</p>

                        <h2>Culture</h2>
                        <p>This semester, I have made a concerted effort to broaden my understanding of different cultural perspectives, both in terms of organizational culture and international cultures. Through my coursework and various extracurricular activities, I have had the opportunity to engage with individuals from diverse backgrounds. For example, in one of my business classes, we conducted a group project that required us to analyze the organizational culture and decision-making processes of a multinational corporation. By researching the company's history, values, and management style, I gained valuable insights into how cultural norms and expectations can shape an organization's internal dynamics and external operations. Additionally, I recently attended a campus event hosted by the international student association, which featured presentations and cultural performances from students representing countries across Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Listening to their personal experiences and learning about their traditions has helped me develop a deeper appreciation for the richness and complexity of global cultures. Moving forward, I am committed to continued learning and cross-cultural exchange, as I believe that cultivating cultural awareness and sensitivity is essential for success in our increasingly interconnected world.</p>

                        <h2>Competencies</h2>
                        <p>Since the start of the fall semester, I have focused on improving my visual communication skills. One key area I have worked on is creating more effective data visualizations. Through practice and research, I have learned techniques for displaying complex information in a clear, compelling way using charts, graphs, and other visual elements. I've experimented with different chart types, color palettes, and labeling approaches to determine what best highlights the key insights I want to convey. I've also paid closer attention to the overall design and layout of my visuals, ensuring they have a cohesive, professional look and feel. Additionally, I've learned how to leverage software tools like Excel and Tableau to automate the process of pulling data, generating visualizations, and updating them as new information becomes available. These skills have allowed me to elevate the quality and impact of the data-driven presentations and reports I create, making complex topics more understandable and engaging for my audience.</p>
